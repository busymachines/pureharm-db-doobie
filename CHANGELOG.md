# unreleased

# 0.3.0-M1

This is the first release for a stable Scala 3 version, and with cats-effect 3 support!

### :warning: breaking
- `pureharm-db-doobie` now depends on cats-effect `3.2.1` (w/ doobie `1.0.0-M5`), and the corresponding dependencies for it.
- `pureharm-db-doobie-ce2` is binary, and source compatible with `pureharm-db-doobie` from version `0.2.0`, so if you haven't migrated to CE3 yet, use the former module.
